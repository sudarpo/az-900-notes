## 2.1. Describe the core Azure architectural components

### describe Regions

A region is a set of datacenters deployed within a latency-defined perimeter and connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network.

- Regions provide customers the flexibility and scale needed to bring applications closer to their users.
- Regions preserve data residency and offer comprehensive compliance and resiliency options for customers.

A geography is a discrete market, typically containing two or more regions, that preserves data residency and compliance boundaries.

**Special Azure regions**

- US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa and more
- China East, China North and more: unique partnership between Microsoft and 21Vianet

#### Region Pairs

- Each Azure region is paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away, which together make a region pair.
- **Physical isolation**. When possible, Azure prefers at least 300 miles of separation between datacenters in a regional pair, although this isn't practical or possible in all geographies.
- **Platform-provided replication**. Some services such as Geo-Redundant Storage provide automatic replication to the paired region.
- **Region recovery order**. In the event of a broad outage, recovery of one region is prioritized out of every pair. Applications that are deployed across paired regions are guaranteed to have one of the regions recovered with priority.
- **Sequential updates**. Planned Azure system updates are rolled out to paired regions sequentially (not at the same time) to minimize downtime, the effect of bugs, and logical failures in the rare event of a bad update.

Additional advantages of region pairs include:

- If there's an extensive Azure outage, one region out of every pair is prioritized to make sure at least one is restored as quick as possible for applications hosted in that region pair.
- Planned Azure updates are rolled out to paired regions one region at a time to minimize downtime and risk of application outage.
- Data continues to reside within the same geography as its pair (except for Brazil South) for tax and law enforcement jurisdiction purposes.

### describe Availability Zones

![availability-options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/wwl-azure/discuss-core-azure-architectural-components/media/availability-options.png)

**Availability Zones** are physically separate locations within an Azure region.  
Each Availability Zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.

Availability Zone features

- Each availability zone is an isolation boundary containing one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.
- If one availability zone goes down, the other continues working.
- The availability zones are typically connected to each other through very fast, private fiber-optic networks.
- Availability zones allow customers to run mission-critical applications with high availability and low-latency replication.
- Availability zones are offered as a service within Azure, and to ensure resiliency, thereâ€™s a minimum of three separate zones in all enabled regions.

**Availability sets** are a way for you to ensure your application remains online if a high-impact maintenance event is required, or if a hardware failure occurs.

- Availability sets are made up of Update domains (UD) and Fault domains (FD).
- Update domains. When a maintenance event occurs (such as a performance update or critical security patch applied to the host), the update is sequenced through update domains.
  _Update domains_ are a logical section of the datacenter, and they are implemented with software and logic.
- Fault domains. Fault domains provide for the physical separation of your workload across different hardware in the datacenter. This includes power, cooling, and network hardware that supports the physical servers located in server racks. In the event the hardware that supports a server rack becomes unavailable, only that rack of servers would be affected by the outage.

### describe Resource Groups

- A resource group is a unit of management for your resources in Azure.
- A container that allows you to aggregate and manage all the resources required for your application in a single manageable unit.
- Allows you to manage the application collectively over its lifecycle.

Manage and apply the following resources at resource group level:

- Metering and billing
- Policies
- Monitoring and alerts
- Quotas
- Access control

### describe Azure Resource Manager

> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/discuss-core-azure-architectural-components/9-explore-azure-resource-manager  
> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview

- Azure Resource Manager is a management layer in which resource groups and all the resources within it are created, configured, managed, and deleted.
- It provides a consistent management layer which allows you automate the deployment and configuration of resources using different automation and scripting tools, such as Microsoft Azure PowerShell, Azure Command-Line Interface (Azure CLI), Azure portal, REST API, and client SDKs.

With Azure Resource Manager, you can:

- **Deploy Application resources**. Update, manage, and delete all the resources for your solution in a single, coordinated operation.
- **Organize resources**. Manage your infrastructure through declarative templates rather than scripts. You can view which resources are linked by a dependency, and you can apply tags to resources to categorize them for management tasks, such as billing.
- **Control access and resources**. You can control who in your organization can perform actions on the resources. You manage permissions by defining roles, adding users or groups to the roles, and applying policies at resource group level. Examples of elements you may wish to control are: enforcing naming convention on resources, limiting which types and instances of resources can be deployed, or limiting which regions can host a type of resource.

#### The benefits of using Resource Manager

- Manage your infrastructure through declarative templates rather than scripts.
- Deploy, manage, and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group, rather than handling these resources individually.
- Redeploy your solution throughout the development lifecycle and have confidence your resources are deployed in a consistent state.
- Define the dependencies between resources so they're deployed in the correct order.
- Apply access control to all services because Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is natively integrated into the management platform.
- Apply tags to resources to logically organize all the resources in your subscription.
- Clarify your organization's billing by viewing costs for a group of resources sharing the same tag.

### describe the benefits and usage of core Azure architectural components

## 2.2. Describe some of the core products available in Azure

### describe products available for Compute such as Virtual Machines, Virtual Machine Scale Sets, App Services, Azure Container Instances (ACI) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

**Azure Compute Services**

- Azure virtual machines: create and use virtual machines in the cloud.  
  _Similar to EC2 Instances (AWS)_

- Virtual machine scale sets: Azure compute resource that you can use to deploy and manage a set of identical VMs.  
  _Similar to Auto Scaling (in AWS)_

  _Similar to AWS Lambda_

- Azure Container Instances (ACI).

  - Azure Container Instances offers the fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure without having to manage any virtual machines or adopt any additional services.
  - It is a PaaS offering that allows you to upload your containers, which it will run for you.
  - _Similar to Elastic Container Service ECS, and Fargate (in AWS)_

- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a complete orchestration service for containers with distributed architectures and large volumes of containers. Orchestration is the task of automating and managing a large number of containers and how they interact.  
  _Similar to Elastic Kubernetes Service ECS (in AWS)_

### describe products available for Networking such as Virtual Network, Load Balancer, VPN Gateway, Application Gateway and Content Delivery Network

**Azure network services**

- Azure Virtual Network

  - Azure Virtual Network enables many types of Azure resources such as Azure VMs to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.
  - A virtual network is scoped to a single region; however, multiple virtual networks from different regions can be connected using virtual network peering.
  - With Azure Virtual Network you can provide isolation, segmentation, communication with on-premises and cloud resources, routing and filtering of network traffic.
  - _Virtual Private Cloud (in AWS)_

- VPN gateway

  - Connects Azure virtual networks to other Azure virtual networks, or customer on-premises networks (Site To Site). Allows end users to connect to Azure services through VPN tunneling (Point To Site).

  - _Network Load Balancer (in AWS)_

- Content Delivery Network: A global content delivery network that delivers audio, video, applications, images, and other files.
  - It is a way to get content to users in their local region to minimize latency.
  - _CloudFront (AWS)_

### describe products available for Storage such as Blob Storage, Disk Storage, File Storage, and Archive Storage

> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/define-core-azure-services-products/9-define-azure-data-categories

**Azure Storage**

- Blob Storage

  - Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data.

  - [Azure storage offers different access tiers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-storage-tiers?tabs=azure-portal), which allow you to store blob object data in the most cost-effective manner. The available access tiers include:

    - Hot - Optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently.
    - Cool - Optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days.
    - Archive - Optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days with flexible latency requirements (on the order of hours). (**Archive Storage**)

  - [Blob storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction) offers three types of resources:

    - The storage account
      A storage account provides a unique namespace in Azure for your data. Every object that you store in Azure Storage has an address that includes your unique account name. The combination of the account name and the Azure Storage blob endpoint forms the base address for the objects in your storage account.

    - A container in the storage account
      A container organizes a set of blobs, similar to a directory in a file system. A storage account can include an unlimited number of containers, and a container can store an unlimited number of blobs.

    - A blob in a container
      Azure Storage supports three types of blobs:

      - Block blobs store text and binary data. Block blobs are made up of blocks of data that can be managed individually. Block blobs store up to about 4.75 TiB of data. Larger block blobs are available in preview, up to about 190.7 TiB
      - Append blobs are made up of blocks like block blobs, but are optimized for append operations. Append blobs are ideal for scenarios such as logging data from virtual machines.
      - Page blobs store random access files up to 8 TB in size. Page blobs store virtual hard drive (VHD) files and serve as disks for Azure virtual machines. For more information about page blobs, see Overview of Azure page blobs

- Disk Storage / [Azure Managed Disks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/managed-disks-overview)

  - Disk storage provides disks for virtual machines, applications, and other services to access and use as they need, similar to how they would in on-premises scenarios.
  - Disk storage allows data to be persistently stored and accessed from an attached virtual hard disk.
  - [Disk types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/disks-types):

- File Storage

  - Azure Files enables you to set up highly available network file shares that can be accessed by using the standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol.
  - You can also read the files using the REST interface or the storage client libraries.

- Azure Queue service is used to store and retrieve messages. Queue messages can be up to 64 KB in size, and a queue can contain millions of messages. Queues are generally used to store lists of messages to be processed asynchronously.

- Azure Table storage stores large amounts of structured data.
  - The service is a NoSQL datastore which accepts authenticated calls from inside and outside the Azure cloud.
  - Azure Tables are ideal for storing structured, non-relational data.

#### Azure Cognitive Services

Cognitive services are a collection of domain-specific pre-trained AI models that can be customized with your data. They are categorized broadly into vision, speech, language, and search.

> https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/#ai-machine-learning

- Vision: Vision makes it possible for apps and services to accurately identify and analyze content within images and videos.
- Speech: Speech services can convert spoken language into text, or produce natural-sounding speech from text using standard (or customizable) voice fonts.
- Language: Language services can understand the meaning of unstructured text or recognize the speakerâ€™s intent.
- Knowledge: Knowledge services create rich knowledge resources that integrate into apps and services.
- Search: Enable apps and services to harness the power of a web-scale, ad-free search engine. Use search services to find information across billions of web pages, images, videos, and news search results.

### describe Serverless computing and Azure products that are available for serverless computing such as Azure Functions, Logic Apps, and Event Grid

**Serverless computing** is a cloud-hosted execution environment that runs your code but abstracts the underlying hosting environment. You create an instance of the service and you add your code. No infrastructure configuration or maintenance is required, or even allowed.

#### Azure Functions

- Azure Functions are ideal when you're only concerned with the code running your service and not the underlying platform or infrastructure.
- Azure Functions are commonly used when you need to perform work in response to an eventâ€”often via a REST request, timer, or message from another Azure serviceâ€”and when that work can be completed quickly, within seconds or less.
- scale automatically,
- charges accrue only when a function is triggered,
- stateless
- _AWS Lambda_

#### Azure Logic Apps (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/logic-apps/)

- Logic Apps is a cloud service that helps you automate and orchestrate tasks, business processes, and workflows when you need to integrate apps, data, systems, and services across enterprises or organizations.
- Logic Apps are designed in a web-based designer and can execute logic triggered by Azure services without writing any code.
- Every logic app workflow starts with a trigger, which fires when a specific event happens, or when new available data meets specific criteria.
- _AWS Step Functions; Simple Workflow Service (SWF)_

#### Azure Event Grid (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/event-grid/overview)

Event Grid allows you to easily build applications with event-based architectures.

- A fully managed event routing service that allows for uniform event consumption using a publish/subscribe model.
- _AWS SNS Simple Notification Service_

### describe DevOps solutions available on Azure such as Azure DevOps and Azure DevTest Labs

[DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/solutions/devops/) (Development and Operations) brings together people, processes, and technology, automating software delivery to provide continuous value to your users. Azure DevOps Services allows you to create, build, and release pipelines that provide continuous integration, delivery, and deployment for your applications.

#### DevOps Services

- DevOps Services provides development collaboration tools including high-performance pipelines, free private Git repositories, configurable Kanban boards, and extensive automated and cloud-based load testing.
- DevOps Services was formerly known as Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS).

#### Azure Lab Services (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/devtest-lab/)

- Lab Services is a service that helps developers and testers quickly create environments in Azure, while minimizing waste and controlling cost.
- Users can test their latest application versions by quickly provisioning Windows and Linux environments using reusable templates and artifacts. You can easily integrate your deployment pipeline with DevTest Labs to provision on-demand environments.
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/devtest-labs/devtest-lab-overview

**Azure DevTest Labs** - This service enables you to quickly set up an environment for your team (for example: development environment, or test environment in the cloud). A lab owner creates a lab, provisions Windows, or Linux virtual machines, installs the necessary software and tools, and makes them available to lab users. Lab users connect to virtual machines (VMs) in the lab, and use them for their day-to-day work, short-term projects. Once users start utilizing resources in the lab, a lab admin can analyze cost and usage across multiple labs, and set overarching policies to optimize your organization or team's costs.

**Azure Lab Services** - This service lets you create managed lab types. Currently, classroom labs is the only type of managed lab that's supported by Azure Lab Services. The service itself handles all the infrastructure management for a managed lab type, from spinning up VMs to handling errors, and scaling the infrastructure. After an IT admin creates a lab account in Azure Lab Services, an instructor can quickly set up a lab for his class, specify the number and type of VMs that are need to exercises in the class, and add users to the class. Once a user registers to the class, the user can access the VM to do exercises for the class.

You can create two types of labs: **managed lab types** with Azure Lab Services and **labs** with Azure Lab Services (DevTest Labs).

Azure Management tools.  
There are tools available for the command line, language-specific Software Development Kits (SDKs), developer tools, tools for migration, and many others.

### describe Azure tools such as Azure Portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI and Cloud Shell

#### Azure portal

The Azure portal is a public website that you can access with any web browser. After you sign in with your Azure account, you can create, manage, and monitor any available Azure services. You can identify a service you're looking for, get links for help on a topic, and deploy, manage, and delete resources. It also guides you through complex administrative tasks using wizards and tooltips.

The dashboard view provides high-level details about your Azure environment. You can customize the portal view as you need by moving and resizing tiles, displaying particular services of interest, accessing links for help and support, and providing feedback.

#### Azure PowerShell (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/?view=azps-4.4.0)

Azure PowerShell is a module that you add to Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Core that enables you to connect to your Azure subscription and manage resources. Azure PowerShell requires Windows PowerShell to function. PowerShell provides services such as the shell window and command parsing. Azure PowerShell then adds the Azure-specific commands.

#### Azure CLI (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest)

Azure CLI is a cross-platform command-line program that connects to Azure and executes administrative commands on Azure resources. Cross platform means that it can be run on Windows, Linux, or macOS.

#### Cloud Shell

Azure Cloud Shell is a browser-based scripting environment in your portal. It provides the flexibility of choosing the shell experience that best suits the way you work. Linux users can opt for a Bash experience, while Windows users can opt for PowerShell.
