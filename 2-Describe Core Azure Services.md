# 2. Describe Core Azure Services (30-35%)

## 2.1. Describe the core Azure architectural components

### describe Regions

A region is a set of datacenters deployed within a latency-defined perimeter and connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network.

- Regions provide customers the flexibility and scale needed to bring applications closer to their users.
- Regions preserve data residency and offer comprehensive compliance and resiliency options for customers.

A geography is a discrete market, typically containing two or more regions, that preserves data residency and compliance boundaries.

**Special Azure regions**

- US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa and more
- China East, China North and more: unique partnership between Microsoft and 21Vianet

#### Region Pairs

- Each Azure region is paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away, which together make a region pair.
- **Physical isolation**. When possible, Azure prefers at least 300 miles of separation between datacenters in a regional pair, although this isn't practical or possible in all geographies.
- **Platform-provided replication**. Some services such as Geo-Redundant Storage provide automatic replication to the paired region.
- **Region recovery order**. In the event of a broad outage, recovery of one region is prioritized out of every pair. Applications that are deployed across paired regions are guaranteed to have one of the regions recovered with priority.
- **Sequential updates**. Planned Azure system updates are rolled out to paired regions sequentially (not at the same time) to minimize downtime, the effect of bugs, and logical failures in the rare event of a bad update.

Additional advantages of region pairs include:

- If there's an extensive Azure outage, one region out of every pair is prioritized to make sure at least one is restored as quick as possible for applications hosted in that region pair.
- Planned Azure updates are rolled out to paired regions one region at a time to minimize downtime and risk of application outage.
- Data continues to reside within the same geography as its pair (except for Brazil South) for tax and law enforcement jurisdiction purposes.

### describe Availability Zones

![availability-options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/wwl-azure/discuss-core-azure-architectural-components/media/availability-options.png)

**Availability Zones** are physically separate locations within an Azure region.  
Each Availability Zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.

Availability Zone features

- Each availability zone is an isolation boundary containing one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.
- If one availability zone goes down, the other continues working.
- The availability zones are typically connected to each other through very fast, private fiber-optic networks.
- Availability zones allow customers to run mission-critical applications with high availability and low-latency replication.
- Availability zones are offered as a service within Azure, and to ensure resiliency, thereâ€™s a minimum of three separate zones in all enabled regions.

**Availability sets** are a way for you to ensure your application remains online if a high-impact maintenance event is required, or if a hardware failure occurs.

- Availability sets are made up of Update domains (UD) and Fault domains (FD).
- Update domains. When a maintenance event occurs (such as a performance update or critical security patch applied to the host), the update is sequenced through update domains.
  _Update domains_ are a logical section of the datacenter, and they are implemented with software and logic.
- Fault domains. Fault domains provide for the physical separation of your workload across different hardware in the datacenter. This includes power, cooling, and network hardware that supports the physical servers located in server racks. In the event the hardware that supports a server rack becomes unavailable, only that rack of servers would be affected by the outage.

### describe Resource Groups

- A resource group is a unit of management for your resources in Azure.
- A container that allows you to aggregate and manage all the resources required for your application in a single manageable unit.
- Allows you to manage the application collectively over its lifecycle.

Manage and apply the following resources at resource group level:

- Metering and billing
- Policies
- Monitoring and alerts
- Quotas
- Access control

### describe Azure Resource Manager

> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/discuss-core-azure-architectural-components/9-explore-azure-resource-manager  
> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview

- Azure Resource Manager is a management layer in which resource groups and all the resources within it are created, configured, managed, and deleted.
- It provides a consistent management layer which allows you automate the deployment and configuration of resources using different automation and scripting tools, such as Microsoft Azure PowerShell, Azure Command-Line Interface (Azure CLI), Azure portal, REST API, and client SDKs.

With Azure Resource Manager, you can:

- **Deploy Application resources**. Update, manage, and delete all the resources for your solution in a single, coordinated operation.
- **Organize resources**. Manage your infrastructure through declarative templates rather than scripts. You can view which resources are linked by a dependency, and you can apply tags to resources to categorize them for management tasks, such as billing.
- **Control access and resources**. You can control who in your organization can perform actions on the resources. You manage permissions by defining roles, adding users or groups to the roles, and applying policies at resource group level. Examples of elements you may wish to control are: enforcing naming convention on resources, limiting which types and instances of resources can be deployed, or limiting which regions can host a type of resource.

#### The benefits of using Resource Manager

- Manage your infrastructure through declarative templates rather than scripts.
- Deploy, manage, and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group, rather than handling these resources individually.
- Redeploy your solution throughout the development lifecycle and have confidence your resources are deployed in a consistent state.
- Define the dependencies between resources so they're deployed in the correct order.
- Apply access control to all services because Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is natively integrated into the management platform.
- Apply tags to resources to logically organize all the resources in your subscription.
- Clarify your organization's billing by viewing costs for a group of resources sharing the same tag.

## 2.2. Describe some of the core products available in Azure

### describe products available for Compute such as Virtual Machines, Virtual Machine Scale Sets, App Services, Azure Container Instances (ACI) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

**Azure Compute Services**

- Azure virtual machines: create and use virtual machines in the cloud. _Similar to EC2 Instances_
- Virtual machine scale sets: Azure compute resource that you can use to deploy and manage a set of identical VMs. _Similar to Auto Scaling (in AWS)_
- App services: quickly build, deploy, and scale enterprise-grade web, mobile, and API apps running on any platform. A fully managed platform for building, deploying and scaling your web apps. _Similar to Elastic Beanstalk and LightSail (in AWS)_
- Functions: are ideal when you're concerned only about the code running your service and not the underlying platform or infrastructure. _Similar to AWS Lambda._
- Azure Container Instances (ACI).
  - Azure Container Instances offers the fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure without having to manage any virtual machines or adopt any additional services.
  - It is a PaaS offering that allows you to upload your containers, which it will run for you.
  - _Similar to Elastic Container Service ECS, and Fargate (in AWS)_
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a complete orchestration service for containers with distributed architectures and large volumes of containers. Orchestration is the task of automating and managing a large number of containers and how they interact. _Similar to Elastic Kubernetes Service ECS (in AWS)_

### describe products available for Networking such as Virtual Network, Load Balancer, VPN Gateway, Application Gateway and Content Delivery Network

**Azure network services**

- Azure Virtual Network

  - Azure Virtual Network enables many types of Azure resources such as Azure VMs to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.
  - A virtual network is scoped to a single region; however, multiple virtual networks from different regions can be connected using virtual network peering.
  - With Azure Virtual Network you can provide isolation, segmentation, communication with on-premises and cloud resources, routing and filtering of network traffic.
  - _Virtual Private Cloud (in AWS)_

- VPN gateway

  - Connects Azure virtual networks to other Azure virtual networks, or customer on-premises networks (Site To Site). Allows end users to connect to Azure services through VPN tunneling (Point To Site).

- Azure Application Gateway

  - Application Gateway is a layer 7 load balancer. It supports SSL termination, cookie-based session affinity, and round robin for load-balancing traffic.

  - _Application Load Balancer in AWS_

- Azure Load Balancer

  - Azure Load Balancer can provide scale for your applications and create high availability for your services.
