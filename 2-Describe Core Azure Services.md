## 2.1. Describe the core Azure architectural components

### describe Regions

A region is a set of datacenters deployed within a latency-defined perimeter and connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network.

- Regions provide customers the flexibility and scale needed to bring applications closer to their users.
- Regions preserve data residency and offer comprehensive compliance and resiliency options for customers.

A geography is a discrete market, typically containing two or more regions, that preserves data residency and compliance boundaries.

**Special Azure regions**

- US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa and more
- China East, China North and more: unique partnership between Microsoft and 21Vianet

#### Region Pairs

- Each Azure region is paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away, which together make a region pair.
- **Physical isolation**. When possible, Azure prefers at least 300 miles of separation between datacenters in a regional pair, although this isn't practical or possible in all geographies.
- **Platform-provided replication**. Some services such as Geo-Redundant Storage provide automatic replication to the paired region.
- **Region recovery order**. In the event of a broad outage, recovery of one region is prioritized out of every pair. Applications that are deployed across paired regions are guaranteed to have one of the regions recovered with priority.
- **Sequential updates**. Planned Azure system updates are rolled out to paired regions sequentially (not at the same time) to minimize downtime, the effect of bugs, and logical failures in the rare event of a bad update.

Additional advantages of region pairs include:

- If there's an extensive Azure outage, one region out of every pair is prioritized to make sure at least one is restored as quick as possible for applications hosted in that region pair.
- Planned Azure updates are rolled out to paired regions one region at a time to minimize downtime and risk of application outage.
- Data continues to reside within the same geography as its pair (except for Brazil South) for tax and law enforcement jurisdiction purposes.

### describe Availability Zones

![availability-options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/wwl-azure/discuss-core-azure-architectural-components/media/availability-options.png)

**Availability Zones** are physically separate locations within an Azure region.  
Each Availability Zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.

Availability Zone features

- Each availability zone is an isolation boundary containing one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.
- If one availability zone goes down, the other continues working.
- The availability zones are typically connected to each other through very fast, private fiber-optic networks.
- Availability zones allow customers to run mission-critical applications with high availability and low-latency replication.
- Availability zones are offered as a service within Azure, and to ensure resiliency, thereâ€™s a minimum of three separate zones in all enabled regions.

**Availability sets** are a way for you to ensure your application remains online if a high-impact maintenance event is required, or if a hardware failure occurs.

- Availability sets are made up of Update domains (UD) and Fault domains (FD).
- Update domains. When a maintenance event occurs (such as a performance update or critical security patch applied to the host), the update is sequenced through update domains.
  _Update domains_ are a logical section of the datacenter, and they are implemented with software and logic.
- Fault domains. Fault domains provide for the physical separation of your workload across different hardware in the datacenter. This includes power, cooling, and network hardware that supports the physical servers located in server racks. In the event the hardware that supports a server rack becomes unavailable, only that rack of servers would be affected by the outage.

### describe Resource Groups

- A resource group is a unit of management for your resources in Azure.
- A container that allows you to aggregate and manage all the resources required for your application in a single manageable unit.
- Allows you to manage the application collectively over its lifecycle.

Manage and apply the following resources at resource group level:

- Metering and billing
- Policies
- Monitoring and alerts
- Quotas
- Access control

### describe Azure Resource Manager

> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/discuss-core-azure-architectural-components/9-explore-azure-resource-manager  
> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview

- Azure Resource Manager is a management layer in which resource groups and all the resources within it are created, configured, managed, and deleted.
- It provides a consistent management layer which allows you automate the deployment and configuration of resources using different automation and scripting tools, such as Microsoft Azure PowerShell, Azure Command-Line Interface (Azure CLI), Azure portal, REST API, and client SDKs.

With Azure Resource Manager, you can:

- **Deploy Application resources**. Update, manage, and delete all the resources for your solution in a single, coordinated operation.
- **Organize resources**. Manage your infrastructure through declarative templates rather than scripts. You can view which resources are linked by a dependency, and you can apply tags to resources to categorize them for management tasks, such as billing.
- **Control access and resources**. You can control who in your organization can perform actions on the resources. You manage permissions by defining roles, adding users or groups to the roles, and applying policies at resource group level. Examples of elements you may wish to control are: enforcing naming convention on resources, limiting which types and instances of resources can be deployed, or limiting which regions can host a type of resource.

#### The benefits of using Resource Manager

- Manage your infrastructure through declarative templates rather than scripts.
- Deploy, manage, and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group, rather than handling these resources individually.
- Redeploy your solution throughout the development lifecycle and have confidence your resources are deployed in a consistent state.
- Define the dependencies between resources so they're deployed in the correct order.
- Apply access control to all services because Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is natively integrated into the management platform.
- Apply tags to resources to logically organize all the resources in your subscription.
- Clarify your organization's billing by viewing costs for a group of resources sharing the same tag.

### describe products available for Storage such as Blob Storage, Disk Storage, File Storage, and Archive Storage

> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/define-core-azure-services-products/9-define-azure-data-categories

**Azure Storage**

- Blob Storage

  - Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data.

  - [Azure storage offers different access tiers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-storage-tiers?tabs=azure-portal), which allow you to store blob object data in the most cost-effective manner. The available access tiers include:

    - Hot - Optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently.
    - Cool - Optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days.
    - Archive - Optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days with flexible latency requirements (on the order of hours). (**Archive Storage**)

- Disk Storage

  - Disk storage provides disks for virtual machines, applications, and other services to access and use as they need, similar to how they would in on-premises scenarios.
  - Disk storage allows data to be persistently stored and accessed from an attached virtual hard disk.

- File Storage

  - Azure Files enables you to set up highly available network file shares that can be accessed by using the standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol.
  - You can also read the files using the REST interface or the storage client libraries.

- Azure Queue service is used to store and retrieve messages. Queue messages can be up to 64 KB in size, and a queue can contain millions of messages. Queues are generally used to store lists of messages to be processed asynchronously.

- Azure Table storage stores large amounts of structured data.
  - The service is a NoSQL datastore which accepts authenticated calls from inside and outside the Azure cloud.
  - Azure Tables are ideal for storing structured, non-relational data.
  - You can use Table storage to store and query huge sets of structured, non-relational data, and your tables will scale as demand increases.
