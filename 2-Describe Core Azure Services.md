## 2.1. Describe the core Azure architectural components

### 2.1.A. describe Regions

A region is a set of datacenters deployed within a latency-defined perimeter and connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network.

- Regions provide customers the flexibility and scale needed to bring applications closer to their users.
- Regions preserve data residency and offer comprehensive compliance and resiliency options for customers.

A geography is a discrete market, typically containing two or more regions, that preserves data residency and compliance boundaries.

**Special Azure regions**

- US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa and more
- China East, China North and more: unique partnership between Microsoft and 21Vianet

#### Region Pairs

- Each Azure region is paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away, which together make a region pair.
- **Physical isolation**. When possible, Azure prefers at least 300 miles of separation between datacenters in a regional pair, although this isn't practical or possible in all geographies.
- **Platform-provided replication**. Some services such as Geo-Redundant Storage provide automatic replication to the paired region.
- **Region recovery order**. In the event of a broad outage, recovery of one region is prioritized out of every pair. Applications that are deployed across paired regions are guaranteed to have one of the regions recovered with priority.
- **Sequential updates**. Planned Azure system updates are rolled out to paired regions sequentially (not at the same time) to minimize downtime, the effect of bugs, and logical failures in the rare event of a bad update.
- Data continues to reside within the same geography as its pair (except for Brazil South) for tax and law enforcement jurisdiction purposes.

### 2.1.B. describe Availability Zones

![availability-options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/wwl-azure/discuss-core-azure-architectural-components/media/availability-options.png)

**Availability Zones** are physically separate locations within an Azure region.  
Each Availability Zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.

Availability Zone features

- Each availability zone is an isolation boundary containing one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.
- If one availability zone goes down, the other continues working.
- The availability zones are typically connected to each other through very fast, private fiber-optic networks.
- Availability zones allow customers to run mission-critical applications with high availability and low-latency replication.
- Availability zones are offered as a service within Azure, and to ensure resiliency, there’s a minimum of three separate zones in all enabled regions.

Availability Zones are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers, and SQL databases. Azure services that support Availability Zones fall into two categories:

- Zonal services – you pin the resource to a specific zone (for example, virtual machines, managed disks, IP addresses)
- Zone-redundant services – platform replicates automatically across zones (for example, zone-redundant storage, SQL Database).

**Availability sets** are a way for you to ensure your application remains online if a high-impact maintenance event is required, or if a hardware failure occurs.

- Availability sets are made up of Update domains (UD) and Fault domains (FD).
- Update domains. When a maintenance event occurs (such as a performance update or critical security patch applied to the host), the update is sequenced through update domains.
  _Update domains_ are a logical section of the datacenter, and they are implemented with software and logic.
- Fault domains. Fault domains provide for the physical separation of your workload across different hardware in the datacenter. This includes power, cooling, and network hardware that supports the physical servers located in server racks. In the event the hardware that supports a server rack becomes unavailable, only that rack of servers would be affected by the outage.

### 2.1.C. describe Resource Groups

- A resource group is a unit of management for your resources in Azure.
- A container that allows you to aggregate and manage all the resources required for your application in a single manageable unit.
- All resources must be in a resource group and a resource can only be a member of a single resource group.
- Many resources can be moved between resource groups with some services having specific limitations or requirements to move.
- Resource groups can't be nested.
- Allows you to manage the application collectively over its lifecycle.

Manage and apply the following resources at resource group level:

- Metering and billing
- Policies
- Monitoring and alerts
- Quotas
- Access control

### 2.1.D. describe Azure Resource Manager

> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/discuss-core-azure-architectural-components/9-explore-azure-resource-manager  
> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview

- Azure Resource Manager is a management layer in which resource groups and all the resources within it are created, configured, managed, and deleted.
- It provides a consistent management layer which allows you automate the deployment and configuration of resources using different automation and scripting tools, such as Microsoft Azure PowerShell, Azure Command-Line Interface (Azure CLI), Azure portal, REST API, and client SDKs.

With Azure Resource Manager, you can:

- **Deploy Application resources**. Update, manage, and delete all the resources for your solution in a single, coordinated operation.
- **Organize resources**. Manage your infrastructure through declarative templates rather than scripts. You can view which resources are linked by a dependency, and you can apply tags to resources to categorize them for management tasks, such as billing.
- **Control access and resources**. You can control who in your organization can perform actions on the resources. You manage permissions by defining roles, adding users or groups to the roles, and applying policies at resource group level. Examples of elements you may wish to control are: enforcing naming convention on resources, limiting which types and instances of resources can be deployed, or limiting which regions can host a type of resource.

#### The benefits of using Resource Manager

- Manage your infrastructure through declarative templates rather than scripts.
- Deploy, manage, and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group, rather than handling these resources individually.
- Redeploy your solution throughout the development lifecycle and have confidence your resources are deployed in a consistent state.
- Define the dependencies between resources so they're deployed in the correct order.
- Apply access control to all services because Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is natively integrated into the management platform.
- Apply tags to resources to logically organize all the resources in your subscription.
- Clarify your organization's billing by viewing costs for a group of resources sharing the same tag.

**Resource Manager template** - A JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines one or more resources to deploy to a resource group, subscription, management group, or tenant. The template can be used to deploy the resources consistently and repeatedly. See [Template deployment overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview).

#### [App services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/identify-azure-solutions/9-explore-azure-app-service): quickly build, deploy, and scale enterprise-grade web, mobile, and API apps running on any platform.

- _Similar to Elastic Beanstalk and LightSail (in AWS)_
- Docs: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/app-service/
- Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends.
- A fully managed platform for building, deploying and scaling your web apps.
- Host common app service styles, including: web apps; api apps; webjobs; mobile apps;

Key features of Azure App Service

- Multiple languages and frameworks. App Service has first-class support for ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. You can also run PowerShell and other scripts or executables as background services.
- DevOps optimization. Set up continuous integration and deployment with Azure DevOps, GitHub, BitBucket, Docker Hub, or Azure Container Registry. Promote updates through test and staging environments. Manage your apps in App Service by using Azure PowerShell or the cross-platform command-line interface (CLI).
- Global scale with high availability. Scale up or out manually or automatically. Host your apps anywhere in Microsoft's global datacenter infrastructure, and the App Service SLA promises high availability.
- Connections to SaaS platforms and on-premises data. Choose from more than 50 connectors for enterprise systems (such as SAP), SaaS services (such as Salesforce), and internet services (such as Facebook). Access on-premises data using Hybrid Connections and Azure Virtual Networks.
- Security and compliance. App Service is ISO, SOC, and PCI compliant. Authenticate users with Azure Active Directory or with social login (Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft). Create IP address restrictions and manage service identities.
- Application templates. Choose from an extensive list of application templates in the Azure Marketplace, such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.
- Visual Studio integration. Dedicated tools in Visual Studio streamline the work of creating, deploying, and debugging.
- API and mobile features. App Service provides turn-key CORS support for RESTful API scenarios, and simplifies mobile app scenarios by enabling authentication, offline data sync, push notifications, and more.
- Serverless code. Run a code snippet or script on-demand without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure, and pay only for the compute time your code actually uses.

The pricing tier of an App Service plan:

- Shared compute: Free and Shared, the two base tiers, runs an app on the same Azure VM as other App Service apps, including apps of other customers. These tiers allocate CPU quotas to each app that runs on the shared resources, and the resources cannot scale out.
- Dedicated compute: The Basic, Standard, Premium, and PremiumV2 tiers run apps on dedicated Azure VMs. Only apps in the same App Service plan share the same compute resources. The higher the tier, the more VM instances are available to you for scale-out.
- Isolated: This tier runs dedicated Azure VMs on dedicated Azure Virtual Networks. It provides network isolation on top of compute isolation to your apps. It provides the maximum scale-out capabilities.

#### Azure Container Instances (ACI)

- Docs: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/
- Azure Container Instances offers the fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure without having to manage any virtual machines or adopt any additional services.
- It is a PaaS offering that allows you to upload your containers, which it will run for you.
- Fast startup times: Containers offer significant startup benefits over virtual machines (VMs).
- _Similar to Elastic Container Service ECS, and Fargate (in AWS)_

#### Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

- Docs: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a complete orchestration service for containers with distributed architectures and large volumes of containers.
- Orchestration is the task of automating and managing a large number of containers and how they interact.
- _Similar to Elastic Kubernetes Service EKS (in AWS)_

### 2.2.B. describe products available for Networking such as Virtual Network, Load Balancer, VPN Gateway, Application Gateway and Content Delivery Network

Azure network services (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/?product=networking)

#### Azure Virtual Network ([VNet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview))

- VNet is the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure.
- Azure Virtual Network enables many types of Azure resources such as Azure VMs to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.
- A virtual network is scoped to a single region; however, multiple virtual networks from different regions can be connected using virtual network peering.
- With Azure Virtual Network you can provide isolation, segmentation, communication with on-premises and cloud resources, routing and filtering of network traffic.
- _VPC Virtual Private Cloud (in AWS)_

Concepts

- Address space: When creating a VNet, you must specify a custom private IP address space using public and private (RFC 1918) addresses.
- Subnets: Subnets enable you to segment the virtual network into one or more sub-networks and allocate a portion of the virtual network's address space to each subnet.
- Regions: VNet is scoped to a single region/location;
- Subscription: VNet is scoped to a subscription.

#### VPN Gateway

- Connects Azure virtual networks to other Azure virtual networks, or customer on-premises networks (Site To Site). Allows end users to connect to Azure services through VPN tunneling (Point To Site).
- Point-to-site VPN (VPN over SSTP _Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol_): Established between a virtual network and a single computer in your network.
- Site-to-site VPN (IPsec/IKE VPN tunnel): Established between your on-premises VPN device and an Azure VPN Gateway that is deployed in a virtual network.
- Each virtual network can have only one VPN gateway.
- However, you can create multiple connections to the same VPN gateway.
- When you create multiple connections to the same VPN gateway, all VPN tunnels share the available gateway bandwidth.

#### Azure Application Gateway (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/overview)

- Application Gateway is a layer 7 (Application layer) load balancer. It supports SSL termination, cookie-based session affinity, and round robin for load-balancing traffic.
- _Application Load Balancer in AWS_
- Application Gateway can make routing decisions based on additional attributes of an HTTP request, for example URI path or host headers.

#### Azure Load Balancer (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview)

- Azure Load Balancer can provide scale for your applications and create high availability for your services.
- Azure Load Balancer load-balances traffic at layer 4 (_transport layer_ TCP or UDP).
- Load Balancer supports inbound and outbound scenarios, provides low latency and high throughput, and scales up to millions of flows for all Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) applications.
- _Network Load Balancer (in AWS)_
- A **public load balancer** can provide outbound connections for virtual machines (VMs) inside your virtual network. These connections are accomplished by translating their private IP addresses to public IP addresses. Public Load Balancers are used to load balance internet traffic to your VMs.
- An **internal (or private) load balancer** is used where private IPs are needed at the frontend only. Internal load balancers are used to load balance traffic inside a virtual network. A load balancer frontend can be accessed from an on-premises network in a hybrid scenario.
- Comparison of Standard Load Balancer vs Basic Load Balancer: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/skus

#### Content Delivery Network (CDN)

- A global content delivery network that delivers audio, video, applications, images, and other files.
- CDN is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users.
- CDNs store cached content on edge servers in point-of-presence (POP) locations that are close to end users, to minimize latency.
- _CloudFront (AWS)_
- Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) includes four products:
  - Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft,
  - Azure CDN Standard from Akamai,
  - Azure CDN Standard from Verizon, and
  - Azure CDN Premium from Verizon.

### 2.2.C. describe products available for Storage such as Blob Storage, Disk Storage, File Storage, and Archive Storage

> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/define-core-azure-services-products/9-define-azure-data-categories

**Azure Storage** https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/

- Azure Blobs: A massively scalable object store for text and binary data. Also includes support for big data analytics through Data Lake Storage Gen2.
- Azure Files: Managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments.
- Azure Queues: A messaging store for reliable messaging between application components.
- Azure Tables: A NoSQL store for schemaless storage of structured data.
- Azure Disks: Block-level storage volumes for Azure VMs.

Each service is accessed through a storage account. To get started, see [Create a storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal).

#### Blob Storage [docs-Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-overview) | [docs-Comparison](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json)

- Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data.

- [Blob storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction) offers three types of resources:

  - **The storage account**
    A storage account provides a unique namespace in Azure for your data. Every object that you store in Azure Storage has an address that includes your unique account name. The combination of the account name and the Azure Storage blob endpoint forms the base address for the objects in your storage account.

  - **A container** in the storage account
    A container organizes a set of blobs, similar to a directory in a file system. A storage account can include an unlimited number of containers, and a container can store an unlimited number of blobs.

  - **A blob in a container**
    Azure Storage supports [three types of blobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/understanding-block-blobs--append-blobs--and-page-blobs):

    - **Block blobs** store text and binary data. Block blobs are made up of blocks of data that can be managed individually. Block blobs store up to about 4.75 TiB of data. Larger block blobs are available in preview, up to about 190.7 TiB
    - **Append blobs** are made up of blocks like block blobs, but are optimized for append operations. Append blobs are ideal for scenarios such as logging data from virtual machines.
    - **Page blobs** store random access files up to 8 TB in size. Page blobs store virtual hard drive (VHD) files and serve as disks for Azure virtual machines. For more information about page blobs, see Overview of [Azure page blobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-pageblob-overview?tabs=dotnet).

- [Azure storage offers different **access tiers**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-storage-tiers?tabs=azure-portal), which allow you to store blob object data in the most cost-effective manner. The available access tiers include:

  - Hot - Optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently.
  - Cool - Optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days.
  - Archive - Optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days with flexible latency requirements (on the order of hours). (**Archive Storage**)

- Azure block blob storage offers [two different performance tiers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-performance-tiers):

  - **Premium**: optimized for high transaction rates and single-digit consistent storage latency. Example workloads: interactive workloads (interactive updates and user feedback); analytics; artificial intelligence; data transformation.
  - **Standard**: optimized for high capacity and high throughput. Example workloads: backup and disaster recovery datasets; media content; bulk data processing.

**Storage Account overview**
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview#types-of-storage-accounts

Azure Storage offers several types of storage accounts.

- General-purpose v2 accounts: Basic storage account type for blobs, files, queues, and tables. Recommended for most scenarios using Azure Storage.
- General-purpose v1 accounts: Legacy account type for blobs, files, queues, and tables. Use general-purpose v2 accounts instead when possible.
- BlockBlobStorage accounts: Storage accounts with premium performance characteristics for block blobs and append blobs. Recommended for scenarios with high transactions rates, or scenarios that use smaller objects or require consistently low storage latency.
- FileStorage accounts: Files-only storage accounts with premium performance characteristics. Recommended for enterprise or high performance scale applications.
- BlobStorage accounts: Legacy Blob-only storage accounts. Use general-purpose v2 accounts instead when possible.

**Azure Storage redundancy**

- Azure Storage always stores multiple copies of your data so that it is protected from planned and unplanned events, including transient hardware failures, network or power outages, and massive natural disasters.

Primary Region redundancy

- Data in an Azure Storage account is always replicated three times in the primary region.
- Azure Storage offers two options for how your data is replicated in the primary region:

  - Locally redundant storage (LRS)
    - copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region.
    - LRS is the least expensive replication option, but is not recommended for applications requiring high availability.
    - LRS provides at least 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability of objects over a given year.
  - Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)
    - copies your data synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region.
    - For applications requiring high availability, Microsoft recommends using ZRS in the primary region, and also replicating to a secondary region.
    - ZRS offers durability for Azure Storage data objects of at least 99.9999999999% (12 9's) over a given year.

Secondary Region redundancy

- For applications requiring high availability, you can choose to additionally copy the data in your storage account to a secondary region that is hundreds of miles away from the primary region.
- Azure Storage offers two options for copying your data to a secondary region:

  - Geo-redundant storage (GRS)
    - Data is replicated synchronously three times in the primary region using locally redundant storage (LRS), then replicated asynchronously to the secondary region.
    - GRS offers durability for Azure Storage data objects of at least 99.99999999999999% (16 9's) over a given year.
  - Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)
    - Data is replicated synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region using zone-redundant storage (ZRS), then replicated asynchronously to the secondary region.
    - GZRS is designed to provide at least 99.99999999999999% (16 9's) durability of objects over a given year.

- With GRS or GZRS, the data in the secondary location isn't available for read or write access unless there is a failover to the secondary region.
- For read access to the secondary location, configure your storage account to use **read-access** geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) or **read-access** geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS).
- Within the secondary location, data is always replicated synchronously three times using LRS. LRS in the secondary region protects your data against hardware failures.

  > - [Change how a storage account is replicated](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/redundancy-migration)

#### Disk Storage / [Azure Managed Disks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/managed-disks-overview)

- Disk storage provides disks for virtual machines, applications, and other services to access and use as they need, similar to how they would in on-premises scenarios. LRS protects your data against server rack and drive failures.
- Disk storage allows data to be persistently stored and accessed from an attached virtual hard disk.
- _AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS)_
- Benefits of managed disks:
  - Highly durable and available, 99.999% availability.
  - Simple and scalable VM deployment.
  - Integration with availability sets.
  - Integration with Availability Zones.
  - Azure Backup support to create a backup job with time-based backups and backup retention policies.
  - Granular access control using RBAC (Azure Role-based access control).
  - Upload your vhd - Direct upload makes it easy to transfer your vhd to an Azure managed disk.
- [Disk types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/disks-types):

### 2.3.D. describe Serverless computing and Azure products that are available for serverless computing such as Azure Functions, Logic Apps, and Event Grid

**Serverless computing** is a cloud-hosted execution environment that runs your code but abstracts the underlying hosting environment. You create an instance of the service and you add your code. No infrastructure configuration or maintenance is required, or even allowed.

#### Azure Functions (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/)

- Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that lets you run event-triggered code without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure.
- Functions are ideal when you're only concerned with the code running your service and not the underlying platform or infrastructure.
- Functions are commonly used when you need to perform work in response to an event—often via a REST request, timer, or message from another Azure service—and when that work can be completed quickly, within seconds or less.
- Scale automatically,
- Charges accrue only when a function is triggered,
- Stateless
- _Similar to AWS Lambda_

#### Azure Logic Apps (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/logic-apps/)

- Logic Apps is a cloud service that helps you automate and orchestrate tasks, business processes, and workflows when you need to integrate apps, data, systems, and services across enterprises or organizations.
- Logic Apps are designed in a web-based designer and can execute logic triggered by Azure services without writing any code.
- Every logic app workflow starts with a trigger, which fires when a specific event happens, or when new available data meets specific criteria.
- _AWS Step Functions; Simple Workflow Service (SWF)_

#### Azure Event Grid (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/event-grid/overview)

Event Grid allows you to easily build applications with event-based architectures.

- A fully managed event routing service that allows for uniform event consumption using a publish/subscribe model.
- _AWS SNS Simple Notification Service_

### 2.3.E. describe DevOps solutions available on Azure such as Azure DevOps and Azure DevTest Labs

[DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/solutions/devops/) (Development and Operations) brings together people, processes, and technology, automating software delivery to provide continuous value to your users. Azure DevOps Services allows you to create, build, and release pipelines that provide continuous integration, delivery, and deployment for your applications.

#### DevOps Services

- DevOps Services provides development collaboration tools including high-performance pipelines, free private Git repositories, configurable Kanban boards, and extensive automated and cloud-based load testing.
- DevOps Services was formerly known as Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS).

#### Azure Lab Services (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/devtest-lab/)

- Lab Services is a service that helps developers and testers quickly create environments in Azure, while minimizing waste and controlling cost.
- Users can test their latest application versions by quickly provisioning Windows and Linux environments using reusable templates and artifacts. You can easily integrate your deployment pipeline with DevTest Labs to provision on-demand environments.
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/devtest-labs/devtest-lab-overview

**Azure DevTest Labs** - This service enables you to quickly set up an environment for your team (for example: development environment, or test environment in the cloud). A lab owner creates a lab, provisions Windows, or Linux virtual machines, installs the necessary software and tools, and makes them available to lab users. Lab users connect to virtual machines (VMs) in the lab, and use them for their day-to-day work, short-term projects. Once users start utilizing resources in the lab, a lab admin can analyze cost and usage across multiple labs, and set overarching policies to optimize your organization or team's costs.

**Azure Lab Services** - This service lets you create managed lab types. Currently, classroom labs is the only type of managed lab that's supported by Azure Lab Services. The service itself handles all the infrastructure management for a managed lab type, from spinning up VMs to handling errors, and scaling the infrastructure. After an IT admin creates a lab account in Azure Lab Services, an instructor can quickly set up a lab for his class, specify the number and type of VMs that are need to exercises in the class, and add users to the class. Once a user registers to the class, the user can access the VM to do exercises for the class.

You can create two types of labs: **managed lab types** with Azure Lab Services and **labs** with Azure Lab Services (DevTest Labs).

There are tools available for the command line, language-specific Software Development Kits (SDKs), developer tools, tools for migration, and many others.

### 2.4.A. describe Azure tools such as Azure Portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI and Cloud Shell

#### Azure portal

The Azure portal is a public website that you can access with any web browser. After you sign in with your Azure account, you can create, manage, and monitor any available Azure services. You can identify a service you're looking for, get links for help on a topic, and deploy, manage, and delete resources. It also guides you through complex administrative tasks using wizards and tooltips.

The dashboard view provides high-level details about your Azure environment. You can customize the portal view as you need by moving and resizing tiles, displaying particular services of interest, accessing links for help and support, and providing feedback.

#### Azure PowerShell (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/?view=azps-4.4.0)

Azure PowerShell is a module that you add to Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Core that enables you to connect to your Azure subscription and manage resources. Azure PowerShell requires Windows PowerShell to function. PowerShell provides services such as the shell window and command parsing. Azure PowerShell then adds the Azure-specific commands.

#### Azure CLI (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest)

Azure CLI is a cross-platform command-line program that connects to Azure and executes administrative commands on Azure resources. Cross platform means that it can be run on Windows, Linux, or macOS.

#### Cloud Shell

Azure Cloud Shell is a browser-based scripting environment in your portal. It provides the flexibility of choosing the shell experience that best suits the way you work. Linux users can opt for a Bash experience, while Windows users can opt for PowerShell.

A storage account is required to use the Cloud Shell and you will be prompted to create one when accessing the Azure Cloud Shell.

#### Azure Mobile App

Microsoft Azure mobile app allows you to access, manage, and monitor all your Azure accounts and resources from your iOS or Android phone or tablet.

#### Azure REST API

Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs are service endpoints that support sets of HTTP operations (methods), which provide create, retrieve, update, or delete access to the service's resources. A REST API defines a set of functions which developers can perform requests and receive responses via HTTP protocol such as GET and POST.
